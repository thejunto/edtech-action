                <p class="rol"><BR>"I'm a reformed private equity guy who found a calling building education businesses. I founded Socratic Ventures in 2010 to find bona fide entrepreneurs and to help them foster big ideas in education. Real change in education will only come if we can build lasting businesses that provide fundamental value to the student. Socratic now has a modest private equity fund focused on furthering the same approach that has helped it to launch UniversityNow, TeachTown, Collegiate Gateways, Synergis Education, Student Loan Benefits and MeasureOne. My experience includes a broad background in education operations as well as both generalist and education-focused private equity investing. Prior to founding Socratic Ventures, I was an Associate with Cotton Creek Capital, a private equity firm in Dallas focused on lower middle market transactions. Previously, I spent two years at Edison Schools in charter school relationship management, as well as managing several new product development initiatives. I began my career with Salomon Smith Barney in investment banking and later joined The Riverside Company in their New York office, where I worked with a generalist team focused on lower middle market private equity investments."

I empower them to leverage technology, processes, and individual skills toward innovation of great products.<BR><BR>With extensive product development and cross-business experience, I help technology companies build profitable products. I am in my element where client requirements, technology, marketing-analytics, and a team come together. I love to brainstorm visionary ideas, translate concepts into clear visions, translate visions into actionable steps, identify ways to measure success, and orchestrate resources into recurring revenue streams. Some would say this is what makes a great product manager. To me, it defines a "linchpin" for an organization I can stand behind.<BR><BR>Product management is at the core of most of my roles. I can wear many hats. As an entrepreneur for a large part of my career, I can focus or shift gears when appropriate. I have gears for staff empowerment, leadership, marketing, data analytics, web development, database design, finance, legal, customer support, and sales. Specialties:  Staff development / empowerment; Wearing multiple hats (and translating different stakeholders); Designing / implementing efficient systems. Skills: Javascript, jQuery, C#, VB, .Net, ASP.NET, mobile, Web services, HTML5, SQL, Database design & optimization, Agile & Scrum development processes, API development, interfaces with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, ODBC.  I was intimately involved in all aspects of business "on my own nickel". I learned how to balance numerous factors to produce effective outcomes on limited budgets. I'm willing to take educated risks toward intimidating goals. Some of the risks paid off and others... still paid off with valuable "learning experiences". I want to share my experiences. I love to see others run with their passions by leading through coaching. The trick is finding a group of diverse people, who if properly empowered, will run in the same direction... and accomplish great things. I can make that happen."</p>
